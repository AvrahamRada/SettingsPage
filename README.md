# SettingsPage
Library of settings page for Advanced Android course

## Description:
Hi :)

This is a library that can help anyone add setting page easily in their app.
I created 6 types of layouts you can add to your setting activity:
1. TITLE
2. TITLE + CONTENT
3. CHECKBOX
4. SWITCH
5. SEEKBAR
6. IMAGE
